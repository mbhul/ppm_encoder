# ppm_encoder
Generate PPM signal using Arduino.

# Notes
This code was originally written by David Hasko and published on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/generate-ppm-signal/ ). Since that service is closed, and not very user friendly, I have put it here, so it does not get lost.

# My Update
I'm using this project to generate a PPM control signal that I feed through an OrangeRX DSMX/DSM2 DIY Tx module, to run my HobbyZone Super Cub from (eventually) a custom built ground station.
